Perfect 👍 Now I’ve seen the last core pieces:

* **`musetalk/models/unet.py`** → wraps Hugging Face `UNet2DConditionModel`, adds positional encoding.
* **`musetalk/models/vae.py`** → wraps `AutoencoderKL` (Stable Diffusion VAE), gives encode/decode + `get_latents_for_unet()`.
* **`musetalk/utils/face_parsing/model.py`** → BiSeNet-based face parser for masks.
* **`musetalk/utils/syncnet.py`** → cross-modal SyncNet (audio–visual alignment), not required for basic inference but useful for lip-sync quality.
* **`musetalk/whisper/audio2feature.py`** → alternate Whisper embedding extractor (segment-wise, 50fps audio features, then sliced to 25fps frames).

Together with what you uploaded earlier, this now covers **all major moving parts**:

* Audio prep (two paths: `audio_processor.py` or `audio2feature.py`).
* Video/face prep (`preprocessing.py`, `face_parsing/model.py`).
* Core models (`vae.py`, `unet.py`).
* Blending (`blending.py`).
* Orchestration (`realtime_inference.py`, `inference.py`).
* Demo wrapper (`app.py`).

So yes — this set is **enough for me to fully understand the inference pipeline** and help you restructure it into a clean `MuseTalkPipeline` wrapper for FastAPI.

👉 Next step: I can sketch the `MuseTalkPipeline` class (imports, `__init__` for global load, `prepare_avatar`, `lip_sync`) so you can drop it under `server/muse_pipeline.py` and call it from FastAPI.

Do you want me to draft that full class skeleton now?
